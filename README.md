# Efficiency-Estimation
Made energy efficiency estimation from data using numpy, pandas with Python <br />

Implementing a nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate two different energy efficiency values of different building shapes. Also extended implementation as weighted KNN algorithm. <br />

The details, results and visuals are written in the report.
